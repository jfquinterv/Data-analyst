# Data Analysis Project for Investment Management

## Introduction

This project is developed as part of my learning journey through the [Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-portfolio-construction-python?specialization=investment-management-python-machine-learning) on Coursera. It aims to apply quantitative analysis and portfolio construction techniques using Python. The project includes analysis of historical financial data, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization techniques to propose investment strategies.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate various data analysis and investment management concepts, including:

- Risk and return analysis
- Portfolio construction
- Performance measurement
- Analysis of industry-specific returns and hedge fund indices

Data used in this project includes historical returns of industry portfolios, market equities, and hedge fund indices.
